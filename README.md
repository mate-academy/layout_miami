# MyBike landing page

In this task, I implemented a landing page, that represents a bicycle shop, using such technologies as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, BEM, SASS.

- a landing page design:
  - [BOSE landing](https://www.figma.com/file/OMjQNb3hg1LKMV4OwyQ3Ao/BOSE?node-id=0%3A1)
- [DEMO LINK](https://viktoriia-ovcharenko.github.io/layout_miami/) 


In the project directory, you can run:
 - npm start
 
Runs the app in the development mode.

The page will reload if you make edits.
