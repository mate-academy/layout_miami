## Code Description and Features
This is the main page of the commercial site of the real estate business. There are 7 main blocks:

**Main screen**
It is the second hardest block because of its full-screen mode. It was quite difficult to choose styles to it to look equally nice on all screens.

**Fast description and Testimonials**
Simple FlexBox blocks.

**Gallery**
Hardest one block. I deliberately implement 'show more' button functionality using CSS. Button connected with checkbox using label for="" and when user touch button he change state of checkbox. And when checkbox state changes, then change styles (height) of neighbor block.

**Consultaions form and Contact us form**
Used correct semantic tags.

**Footer**
Implemented used parallax effect. It has fixed to viewport position and usually hidden by other body elements. But when user scroll down there are empty space after Contact us form without no content and footer became visible.
