--> [CHECKLIST](https://github.com/mate-academy/layout_miami/blob/master/checklist.md)

1. [x] Add a favicon
2. [x] Don’t forget to add a title for the whole web page (it could be the name of your landing)
3. [x] Logos in header and footer should be links to home page
4. [x] Change text color on hover for phone, email and address
5. [x] When you click on ‘CALL TO ORDER’, make sure that there is no 404 error, make it a real link to activate your phone on your laptop/phone
6. [x] Same when you click on logo. There shouldn't be any error. 
7. [ ] In the “Miami best” block, make sure that the “Real estate here” link does not lead to a 404 error, but to a location in Google Maps
8. [x] Pictures in Gallery should increase on hover
9. [ ] Gallery links should open google maps in a new tab `target="_blank"`
10. [x] Photos in the Testimonials section should also increase on hover
11. [x] Make sure everything looks neat on mobile and without horizontal scrolling
12. [x] The speed of animations is the same throughout the landing page (for example, increasing when hovering or moving blocks when scrolling)
13. [ ] Placeholders in the forms suggest what to enter, and if there is a validation of the form, then it is clear in what format to enter the data
14. [ ] Form shouldn't be submitted if some of the fields are not filled
15. [ ] Page shouldn't be reloaded on form submit (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault)
16. [x] Add a smooth scroll for the whole page
17. [x] Fix menu for small screens (if there is not enough space for all the menu items)
    ```css
    .menu {
      /* Move these rules from .menu__content */
      box-sizing: border-box;
      height: 100vh;
      padding: 24px 0;

      background-color: #0075ff;

      /* Add this rule to add scroll when there is not enough space */
      overflow-y: auto;

      ...
    ```
15. [x] To disable page scrolling under the menu add the next code
    ```css
    .page__body--with-menu {
      overflow: hidden;
    }
    ```
    ```js
    window.addEventListener('hashchange', () => {
      if (window.location.hash === '#menu') {
        document.body.classList.add('page__body--with-menu');
      } else {
        document.body.classList.remove('page__body--with-menu');
      }
    });
    ```
16. [ ] Remember to reset default margins for headings (h1, h2, h3, etc.). Make sure that ```<h1>``` is positioned exactly 80px from the bottom of the header.
