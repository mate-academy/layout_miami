  - [MYBIKE landing](https://www.figma.com/file/NZQAIydtHo5QkINyGLHNcq/BIKE-New-Version?node-id=0%3A1)
- watch the lesson videos and implement your page blocks similarly to the videos;
- **DON'T** try to do it `Pixel Perfect` - implement it the most `simple` way so it looks similar;
- when you finish the first block of your page deploy it and create a Pull Request with a [DEMO LINK](https://gretoq.github.io/layout_miami/)
- after each next block do the same (add, commit and push the changes, and deploy the updated demo;
- check yourself using the [CHECKLIST](https://github.com/mate-academy/layout_miami/blob/master/checklist.md) when finished;
