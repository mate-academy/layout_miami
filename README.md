# Project Summary: Bang & Olufsen Frontend Development

I undertook the challenge of developing the **frontend** for the Bang & Olufsen landing page, a distinguished audio brand. The task involved translating a Figma design into a functional and visually attractive website that reflects the premium quality of Bang & Olufsen's products.

## Key Features:

**Responsive Design:** Implemented a responsive layout catering to mobile, tablet, and desktop users for an optimal viewing experience.

**SASS Animations:** Enhanced user interaction with tasteful animations in SASS, including a pulsing phone icon, a smoothly rotating closing icon, zooming images on hover, and an animated link underline in the menu.

**Form Validation:** Ensured a seamless user experience with a validated input form at the bottom. The message input box is extendable for user convenience.

**Smart Link Actions:** Integrated links in the address section to initiate relevant actions, such as making a call, sending an email, or displaying the location in Google Maps.

**Code Quality:** Emphasized clean and maintainable code, promoting efficiency in development and facilitating future enhancements.
