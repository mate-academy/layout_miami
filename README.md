# Miami landing page

- when you finish the first block of your page deploy it and create a Pull Request with a [DEMO LINK](https://artpetrenko.github.io/layout_miami/)

I created a landing page according to Miami's instructions. Used BEM methodology. The container has a limited width, also used a dynamic grid to quickly change the position of pictures and blocks. The landing is adapted and changes in 3 formats - mobile, tablet and display.
