This project is a website for a headphones and speakers store built using HTML, CSS, JS, SASS, and the BEM methodology.

This is a one page website project.

The website consists of several sections, such as the header, recommended products, categories and contact.

One of the most important functionalities is also a dynamically expanding menu that takes up the entire screen and prevents you from scrolling the page, when it is active.

The website design is fully responsive and optimized for different screen sizes. You can check out the live website and the layout on the link above.
