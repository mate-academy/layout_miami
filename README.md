In this task, I created "Miami" landing page with help of knowlage HTML, SCSS, Java Script.
- Every bloks of HTML code has own SCSS file in 'blocks' folder.
- I used Variables and Mixins in each file of styles.
- The speed of animations on the page are same.
- Placeholders in the forms help you what need to enter.
- There is no horizontal scrolling when you use mobile devices.
- The links in the top menus lead to the corresponding blocks of page.
- All buttons, menu items and forms work correct.
