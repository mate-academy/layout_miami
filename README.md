# Bose project

 "Bose project" was done by me using sample from Figma. I've choose this project to show you my knowledge in landing.

 In this project i have used SSCS in stead of CSS in order to be able use variables, functions, nesting. I used simple js to prevent scrolling, also for mostly part of page was used 12 columns grid.
