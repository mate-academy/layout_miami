# Bose landing page

- [DEMO LINK](https://anastasia-babko.github.io/layout_miami/)

- [FIGMA LINK](https://www.figma.com/file/OMjQNb3hg1LKMV4OwyQ3Ao/BOSE?node-id=0%3A1)

- The project is a ready-to-use website page with a navigation, a menu, four sections and a feedback form. The figma design was used for the layout of the page. I used html, scss and javascript in the project.
